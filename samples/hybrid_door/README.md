This directory contains a sample based on the door sample to illustrate DDAPI logic 
and plain AllJoyn logic can be used in the same application with the same busattachment.

Also, there is a self-test option which can be triggered by starting the application with
the environment variable RUNTEST=1. Alternatively, you can start the application in the 
normal way and run the tests with -t.
